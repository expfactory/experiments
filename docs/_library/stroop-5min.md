This is a derivative of the default Experiment Factory Stroop task. It was created to be a more brief and user-friendly version, taking only 5 minutes to complete, using color-blind friendly colors and a black background to reduce eye strain, among other adjustments. 

This task was validated in a preliminary study with 50 participants recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The results suggest this version of the task produces a Stroop effect with the same magnitude as the original version. For more information about the study, see https://osf.io/9pc46
