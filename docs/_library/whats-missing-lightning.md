This was a legacy game that has been ported into its Experiment Factory Reproducible Container version. The games were a collaboration between Vinod Menon's Lab (Jonathan and Christian) and Poldracklab (Vanessa) toward a vision of fun, modern paradigms. If you'd like to make the experiment, it's documentation, or use better, please contribute at the respective repositories.
